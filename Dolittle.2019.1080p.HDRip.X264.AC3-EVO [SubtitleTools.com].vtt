00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:42.252
There once was a peculiar doctor
known for his extraordinary ability.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:46.376
He could talk to animals.

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:49.848
Doctor Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide.

00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:53.184
Even the Queen of England called on him.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:57.624
So grateful for his help
she gifted him a wondrous sanctuary

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.571
whose doors were opened to all creatures.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:07.789
His days belonged to the animals,
but his heart belonged to one woman.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:12.125
Lily the Fearless Explorer.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:16.268
They traveled the globe
going on great adventures.

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:20.629
Defending creatures
who could not defend themselves.

00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:29.410
They made an extraordinary team.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.309
Soon, that team became a family.

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:40.972
With Lily by his side
Dolittle never felt more alive.

00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:45.765
Until one day she left on an adventure.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.149
Lily died at sea.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.716
Heartbroken he locked the gates
of the manor

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:05.695
and completely retreated from the world.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.196
As for me, and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:15.480
we were left to wonder,
could anyone save his?

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:24.584
Until one morning, a most unlikely creature
found its way to Dolittle's life.

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:26.860
A very special boy.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:32.401
In a time when people thought of animals
only as possessions, food, or sport,

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:35.088
this boy felt quite differently.

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:48.381
This way, me scattered crew.

00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:54.067
- Junior flushes him, you shoot, yeah?
- Right. Good plan, dad.

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:57.201
- Get ready. Shoulder your gun.
- Do I have to, uncle?

00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.714
Come on, boy.

00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:05.946
Take that one. Shoot! Shoot!

00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:07.164
Shoot! Shoot!

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:09.688
- I don't know, I can't.
- Shoot! Shoot!

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:15.501
You can't keep missing on purpose.

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:18.431
Oh, look! He hit something this time!

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:29.593
Oh, no. We have to help him.

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:33.981
You don't leave an animal suffering.

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.261
Take it.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.322
He's a very odd boy.

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.220
Follow Poly.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.298
Home of Doctor John and Lily Dolittle.

00:04:16.378 --> 00:04:18.435
We treat all animals--

00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:31.222
Follow Poly.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.754
Secret entrance.

00:05:19.377 --> 00:05:22.173
Poly, where'd you go?

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:41.739
Good dog. Big, white--

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.918
It's no good.

00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:47.122
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here.

00:07:47.202 --> 00:07:48.082
Just ignore them.

00:07:48.162 --> 00:07:51.419
There's no getting past the Kalahari snare,
it's an ingenious design.

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.254
I think you just caught yourself a boy.

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:56.148
Let me see. Wait, I don't wanna see.
Just make it go away!

00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:58.367
Deep breaths, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back.

00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:01.129
Don't be afraid, John. It's just a boy.

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:02.995
This is an opportunity.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:06.161
This is a nightmare!

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:10.899
Pardon me.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.639
Whatever you're doing up there?

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.631
I've come from Buckingham Palace
on urgent business.

00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:22.480
Can you tell me if this is the home
of John Dolittle?

00:08:22.912 --> 00:08:24.349
Who are you?

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:28.052
You may call me Lady Rose.
And you are..?

00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:30.312
Stubbins.

00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:32.974
Could you... help me down?

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.905
This goes against Dolittle's rules.

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.224
Why are humans against the rules again?

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:39.503
If you let humans too close
you'll get hurt more

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:42.615
than you would if you didn't let them
at all. Isn't that right, Doc?

00:08:42.695 --> 00:08:46.378
That's enough everybody. Back to our
routine! We have a very full day.

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.795
John, pull yourself together!

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:52.141
You can't ignore people
just because they're... people.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.288
What if they need help?

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.258
Possum, play dead.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:02.253
This is ridiculous. Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.001
You're the only one with arms.

00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.843
I think chess was enough pressure
for one day.

00:09:06.923 --> 00:09:09.166
Chee-Chee boy.
This is what we trained for.

00:09:09.246 --> 00:09:11.449
Be brave and get rid of them.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.567
- And don't forget your mantra.
- I am not a prisoner of fear?

00:09:16.647 --> 00:09:19.042
You are not a prisoner of fear.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.385
Have you been here before?

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:27.437
The Queen told me all about it.
It's the most unusual place.

00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:29.845
I'm prepared for anything.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.924
Wonderful! A gorilla
answering the door.

00:09:43.122 --> 00:09:46.644
Just as the Queen said.

00:09:52.062 --> 00:09:54.009
Wait a minute.

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:56.371
I have an injured squirrel.

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:06.703
I should've never let you go.

00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:27.215
Hello?

00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:48.509
Oh, look at you!

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:52.326
Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.695
Move, please!
This is my hiding spot.

00:11:01.073 --> 00:11:03.082
Not here.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.981
Are you alright down there?

00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:08.283
Yeah. I'm fine. Go on.

00:11:08.363 --> 00:11:10.053
- Doctor Dolittle.
- Yeah, right.

00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:15.641
You have been summoned to
Buckingham Palace by the Queen herself.

00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:17.634
Go on.

00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:21.479
You should know.
She's fallen gravely ill.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.825
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:28.241
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:31.769
Go... on.
Go on and be gone!

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:36.524
I don't care about anyone,
anything anywhere anymore.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:39.141
The birds will show you out.

00:11:41.237 --> 00:11:45.676
Great. Everything's tidy.
Lunch will be served in a minute now.

00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:55.766
- Smells lovely, Doc.
- Thanks very much.

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:58.487
Hey Doc, save some
for us this time.

00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:04.637
Sorry, Doc. Guess
I'm scared of kids, too.

00:12:04.717 --> 00:12:06.943
Don't worry about that.
Come on. Let's eat.

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:09.585
For that we'll be offering today
a broccoli soup.

00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:12.204
You'll never believe
what we caught in the net.

00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:14.332
The Queen has asked for you
by name, sir.

00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:18.064
Are you hard of hearing?
I told you I'm closed for business.

00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.876
What business?

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:26.333
Treating humans.

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:31.631
Intruder alert!

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:36.380
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not!

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.992
My house is descended into chaos.

00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:43.051
- Is it yours?
- I don't own anybody.

00:12:43.131 --> 00:12:46.005
Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with.

00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:49.584
He's always cold.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:52.706
I have an injured squirrel.

00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:55.414
I don't know what to do.

00:12:55.494 --> 00:12:57.894
How was he injured?

00:12:59.782 --> 00:13:02.414
- I shot him.
- Wha-- I can't hear you.

00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:04.815
I shot him, but it was an accident.

00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:08.046
Of course! An accidental firing upon.

00:13:08.126 --> 00:13:10.241
Humans never change.

00:13:10.321 --> 00:13:12.644
He's very hurt.

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:15.677
Please help him.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.175
Take that. And this.

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:40.719
I'm too beautiful to die.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:59.535
Yes?

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.615
He's with us.

00:14:01.832 --> 00:14:05.429
Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps.
Disinfect the surgery.

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:07.025
You will not tend to a squirrel

00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:09.739
while the Queen of England's life
hangs in the balance!

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:12.278
You don't me very well, do you?

00:14:12.358 --> 00:14:13.575
Don't drop him.

00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:16.731
We have a code red.
Code red. Code red everybody.

00:14:17.672 --> 00:14:20.678
The Doctor is back!

00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:23.352
Hang on, little buddy.

00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:27.952
- Haven't done this in a while.
- Let's get everything the way Doc likes.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.928
Don't worry, we got you, pal.

00:14:37.827 --> 00:14:41.014
Presume to save this squirrel, shall we?

00:14:41.302 --> 00:14:42.923
Okay.

00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:45.353
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:47.435
If I die I swear
I will haunt your house.

00:14:47.515 --> 00:14:49.893
Sterilise the scalpels,
do not lick any instrument--

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.191
Patient's condition is stabilised.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:56.968
They are understanding human,
he's understanding them.

00:14:57.048 --> 00:14:59.524
In their own languages.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:06.834
Going through the left ventricle.
Breathe!

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:09.535
Dab-Dab, forceps please.

00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:10.958
Here you go.

00:15:11.038 --> 00:15:13.473
That's a piece of celery.
Forceps, Doctor.

00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:16.541
- Sorry. Here you go.
- Still, celery.

00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:18.478
- Forceps?
- Carrot.

00:15:18.558 --> 00:15:20.647
- Forceps?
- That's a different piece of celery.

00:15:20.727 --> 00:15:23.058
- Got it. Forceps.
- No. Still celery.

00:15:23.138 --> 00:15:25.139
Never mind. I'll get it myself.

00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:29.302
A human talks to the animals?

00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:32.502
Chee-Chee, brow.

00:15:32.582 --> 00:15:34.694
My brow as well,
when you've got a second.

00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:36.079
Right. Sorry.

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:39.694
I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice.

00:15:39.774 --> 00:15:43.620
Her Majesty has designated this land
in nature preserve.

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:45.769
If she dies...

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.099
the deed will be owned by the Treasury,

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:50.604
and this place goes away.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.123
Shut down?

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.740
There you are.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:58.267
Still got it, Doc.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.581
There, Cheech. That's the spot.

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:05.671
Keep an eye on Kevin, should we?

00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:08.957
He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off.

00:16:14.062 --> 00:16:16.460
Revenge!

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.840
Okay. Okay. Enough
with the pampering.

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:23.140
You need to go and help the Queen.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.228
There are things I no longer do:

00:16:26.308 --> 00:16:28.307
work with humans, or leave the house--

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.597
- Or bathe.
- Exercise.

00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:34.767
Express emotional vulnerability.

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:39.186
Wake up, John! If the Queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.454
And we'll lose this house.

00:16:41.484 --> 00:16:46.235
You're talking out of your tail
feathers, Poly. The deed was for life.

00:16:46.315 --> 00:16:48.764
The last time I checked
I was very much alive.

00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:51.860
The Queen's life, John. Not yours.

00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:55.699
Look at that.
It just rolls off my back.

00:16:55.778 --> 00:16:59.189
I knew I shouldn't've let monkeys
proofread the contract.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.954
Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:05.086
It gets worse.

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:08.641
We'll be thrown out of the gates
right in the middle of hunting season!

00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:11.074
What?!
- No, no. Breathe, Chee-Chee.

00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:12.921
We will be kicked out
if the Queen dies?

00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:15.661
- We gonna be hunted.
- Everybody, calm down.

00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:18.576
Look at the state of him now!

00:17:18.656 --> 00:17:21.941
Fear not. I have an inn
at Regent Park Zoo.

00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:24.720
Everyone pack your bags!

00:17:26.674 --> 00:17:30.834
You help the Queen or we are leaving!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.213
- You are bluffing!
- Don't make me count.

00:17:34.293 --> 00:17:36.293
Don't make me count.

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:38.542
- One.
- Three.

00:17:38.622 --> 00:17:40.622
Two...

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.384
Alright! I'll do it.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.174
Let's get you ready to go, honey.

00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:49.137
- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that.

00:17:49.217 --> 00:17:51.925
- I'll just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him!

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:53.244
Hold still now.

00:17:53.324 --> 00:17:55.600
Get your paws off me!

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.222
This isn't gonna hurt a bit.

00:17:57.302 --> 00:17:59.963
- Let's clean him up.
- How dare you!

00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:02.617
- Hey guys.
- Arthur?

00:18:02.697 --> 00:18:06.860
- How long have you been living in there?
- I don't know. What year is it?

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:11.033
- Dab-Dab got the razor.
- That's still celery.

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:13.302
Nighty night, Doc.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.602
Dolittle used to travel
around the world.

00:18:23.682 --> 00:18:25.659
Look.

00:18:25.739 --> 00:18:30.034
- Ravaging through my private projects?
- How is he?

00:18:30.114 --> 00:18:34.891
First things first. The squirrel's name
is Kevin. Expect a full recovery.

00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:37.946
And after some violent grooming,
it's been decided.

00:18:38.044 --> 00:18:41.376
We will come to you,
to Buckingham Palace after all.

00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:47.556
You are going back to whatever burrow
you emerged from.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.301
Try not to shoot anything
on your way home.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:03.868
Maybe, I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds.

00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:08.226
We'll look after you, Cheech. But we all
going together, just like the old days.

00:19:08.306 --> 00:19:11.875
- Don't forget doc's forceps.
- That's a leek, Dab-Dab.

00:19:11.906 --> 00:19:14.806
- Sure it is.
- Sticks.

00:19:15.674 --> 00:19:17.582
Where are you?

00:19:17.662 --> 00:19:20.293
So, would you care to come along?

00:19:22.444 --> 00:19:25.823
I know. I had other plans as well.

00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:28.534
Hurry up. Hurry up.

00:19:54.543 --> 00:19:56.777
Prepare my ride.

00:19:57.474 --> 00:20:00.054
Today is gonna be a good day.
I'm gonna do nothing,

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:02.478
just prance around,
pick my own thoughts.

00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:06.879
He's walking this way, not a great sign.
He's got no beard, he looks motivated.

00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:08.248
Plimpton, don't be alarmed.

00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:10.465
People only say that when they are
about to be alarming.

00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:13.347
Sorry about this.
And sorry about that.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.099
- Alright.
- I'm unavailable.

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:18.347
Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?

00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:21.026
- We're going to save the Queen, bro.
- I am not your bro!

00:20:21.063 --> 00:20:25.335
- You should be an Eskimo's rug by now.
- Ow, claws! Big claws.

00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:27.614
Now now, Gentlemen.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.510
Oh, you've gained weight.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.247
Why are you riding me? There's
like four horses in front of us.

00:20:34.327 --> 00:20:37.902
Cheer up, angry bird,
kick back and enjoy the ride.

00:20:37.982 --> 00:20:40.072
I am the ride!

00:20:43.392 --> 00:20:47.370
Buckingham Palace. We hit the big time.

00:20:50.489 --> 00:20:53.910
Full speed no longer required!

00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:02.492
Welcome home, milady.

00:21:05.803 --> 00:21:08.109
Guards! Guards!

00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:14.507
Your Ladyship, Rose.

00:21:14.587 --> 00:21:18.603
They are the Queen's own guests.
Treat them accordingly.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:21.922
You better give me some
wide berth. Make way, boys.

00:21:22.002 --> 00:21:23.276
Plimpton!

00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:24.969
- Don't! Stop!
- Don't stop?

00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:27.501
- Alright, decision affirmative.
- Stop!

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.152
Can't see! Oh my God!

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:41.511
Okay.

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.625
I blame the hat.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.092
Doctor Müdfly.

00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:58.616
Lord Badgley.

00:21:58.788 --> 00:22:01.161
I come from the House of Lords.

00:22:01.555 --> 00:22:05.200
There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health.

00:22:06.548 --> 00:22:09.197
I shall continue to leech,

00:22:09.277 --> 00:22:13.066
to circulate the vapors
in the blood stream.

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:15.677
She'll be lucky to last the week.

00:22:19.888 --> 00:22:22.427
This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.883
You got a dying Queen?
Not for long.

00:22:24.963 --> 00:22:27.744
Doctor Dolittle is in the...

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:32.248
- Wait. Wait for me.
- A stowaway, milady.

00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:35.435
- Who claims to be--
- Doctor Dolittle's apprentice.

00:22:35.515 --> 00:22:38.043
It's quite alright, Gareth.

00:22:39.612 --> 00:22:42.327
But if he was my apprentice,
he should fetch my bags

00:22:42.407 --> 00:22:44.407
and keep his gob shut.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:55.300
Animals in the Queen's chamber?
I demand their immediate remov--

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.199
Lady Rose, my apologies.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:00.306
Please forgive me. I didn't realise
that you were a part of...

00:23:00.386 --> 00:23:01.849
John Dolittle.

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:04.620
- Is that Blein?
- Blair.

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:06.109
- Poofling?
- No.

00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:09.269
- It was Muffler?
- No, it's Müdfly!

00:23:09.772 --> 00:23:11.249
- With an u-umlaut.
- Yes.

00:23:11.329 --> 00:23:13.393
- From the German.
- Of course, from the Germans.

00:23:13.473 --> 00:23:14.264
Why is he here?

00:23:14.344 --> 00:23:17.783
Her Majesty has personally requested
Doctor Dolittle.

00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:33.642
Let's get to work.
Alright, Jip, give her a good sniff.

00:23:53.615 --> 00:23:56.083
- You alright, fellow?
- Something smelled wrong.

00:23:56.163 --> 00:23:58.823
And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts.

00:23:58.903 --> 00:24:01.722
- You do love butt.
- I detected a whiff of something else.

00:24:01.802 --> 00:24:03.802
Floral with ---

00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:10.107
I'm perplexed, Doc. I've never
smelt anything like it before.

00:24:11.191 --> 00:24:14.763
Jipsy and I have developed doubts.
May we consult?

00:24:14.843 --> 00:24:18.117
Of course, I'd be more than happy
to help illumining...

00:24:38.827 --> 00:24:42.459
John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.949
Some thought he had a gift
for observation.

00:25:01.283 --> 00:25:03.283
Sorry about that, Mini.

00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.457
Stay here.
Dab-Dab, clear up the humans.

00:25:09.537 --> 00:25:12.622
Boyo, fetch for botanic index,
and the tea tin.

00:25:12.702 --> 00:25:16.036
Everyone out! Do you understand
the words coming out of my bill?

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:24.826
What do you smell, Jip?
Elderberries? Amoque?

00:25:25.194 --> 00:25:27.238
Negative?

00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:31.174
Negative.

00:25:33.124 --> 00:25:35.124
Aye aye.

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.446
What have you found, Dolittle?

00:25:44.526 --> 00:25:46.812
Quite possibly,
the answer to everything.

00:25:46.892 --> 00:25:49.085
- Exposure--
- But he was like this in school.

00:25:49.165 --> 00:25:52.505
"Lean in, lean in...
I'm saying something interesting."

00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:54.533
I am interested.

00:25:54.613 --> 00:25:58.285
The Queen symptoms are due to the effect
of a rare Sumatran plant

00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:00.981
known as the Nightshade flower.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.497
A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month.

00:26:05.851 --> 00:26:10.254
If she is not received
the antidote by then, she will perish.

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:15.245
Is that a Turner?
Must be. What a fine painting.

00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:18.265
I say, Dolittle, what is your plan?

00:26:18.413 --> 00:26:22.194
The plan?
I suppose we do need one.

00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:25.729
The Queen's only hope is the cure
that's never been tested

00:26:25.809 --> 00:26:29.474
from tree that's never been seen
on island that's never been found.

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:33.875
Sounds ridiculous saying it out loud.
But regardless of that...

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:37.997
We have no choice but to embark
on this perilous journey

00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:40.372
to obtain the fruit of the Eden Tree.

00:26:40.442 --> 00:26:42.342
What?

00:26:42.342 --> 00:26:45.743
Eden Tree? Oh my, fantastic!

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:48.878
The Dolittles
with their Eden Tree island.

00:26:48.892 --> 00:26:51.729
- Isn't it enough that your wife--
- Shut up, Blair!

00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:55.714
Sorry, I meant to say,
lovely to see you again, Blair.

00:26:55.794 --> 00:26:58.505
We are off now, ta ta!

00:26:58.585 --> 00:27:02.982
Its fruit is said to cure every malady
known to man, grant eternal life,

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:05.266
even restore the hair on your head.

00:27:05.346 --> 00:27:09.882
You must let nothing pass her lips
that hasn't been made and served by you.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.677
- Clear?
- Yes, I'll see to it.

00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:16.355
That's us to the carriage. Jip, you need
to stay behind and guard the queen.

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:19.342
- Very important.
- Right. Guard-dog mode.

00:27:19.422 --> 00:27:22.626
Stand back everyone,
while I secure the perimeter.

00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:27.188
Excuse me.

00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:35.446
I do so admire how you don't give up.
The Queen is counting on both of you.

00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:37.626
Good luck.

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:43.817
Right. Chop chop.
There is a long voyage in front of us.

00:27:43.897 --> 00:27:45.969
And the boat isn't gonna sail itself.

00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:48.201
Deep breath, Yoshi.

00:27:48.761 --> 00:27:50.869
We haven't got all day.

00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:55.225
- Seems like she's filled up.
- Maybe we could squeeze in one more.

00:27:56.947 --> 00:28:00.011
- Oh, no.
- Plimpton! I mean...

00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:01.913
One more stop, good fellow.

00:28:01.993 --> 00:28:05.016
I can't hear you
because I am not here.

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:07.747
I believe it's time
to go our separate ways.

00:28:07.827 --> 00:28:11.324
- I am going with you.
- Certainly not. Far too treacherous.

00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:13.943
- I'm your apprentice.
- You? No. No.

00:28:14.023 --> 00:28:17.133
Oh, you have an apprentice. You
don't need an apprentice and an ostrich.

00:28:17.213 --> 00:28:18.385
I'll go home.

00:28:18.465 --> 00:28:20.988
I didn't want to be embarrassed,
so I pretend you belonged.

00:28:21.068 --> 00:28:24.116
I was helpful there, wasn't I?

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:27.414
The animals like me,
I don't take up much space.

00:28:27.758 --> 00:28:30.069
I think I belong here.

00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:34.772
Don't make me go home. Please.

00:28:45.941 --> 00:28:48.651
What is that around your neck? Move.

00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:52.389
- I'm worried about the boy, Bethan.
- Give him time. Time is all.

00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:55.871
We're hunters, Bethan. Hunters.

00:28:55.917 --> 00:29:00.205
It has a certain...
We hunt things, he frees things.

00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:04.051
A rabbit, mice--
He carries spiders outside!

00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:07.417
Nobody likes spiders, not even spiders.

00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:10.981
I don't know
how your sister put up with him.

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:41.224
- Poly? What are you doing here?
- Making sure you don't miss the boat.

00:29:41.304 --> 00:29:45.143
Am I talking to an animal?
Just like Dolittle.

00:29:45.223 --> 00:29:50.027
Oh, no. I'm speaking human. Better
than any parrot ever has, actually.

00:29:50.342 --> 00:29:53.761
Now, let's pack some clothes. Come on.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:03.428
- But Dolittle said I belong here.
- Little help, Tutu.

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:06.977
Well, I've never heard him say
anything of the sort.

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:10.129
There's something special
about you, Stubbins.

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:13.563
Something I've only seen
in two other humans.

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:16.694
You belong with us, kid.

00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:19.225
And you let me worry
about Dolittle, that's my job.

00:30:19.277 --> 00:30:24.874
So, are you ready for the adventure
of a lifetime?

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.727
- I'm in.
- Of course you are!

00:30:31.807 --> 00:30:35.353
Poly, let's move, we got a boat
to catch and we're burning daylight!

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:39.059
Fret not, Ma chéri,
we have the perfect plan.

00:30:39.554 --> 00:30:42.599
New plan! New plan!

00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:45.129
Don't let them get away!

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.391
Why are they chasing us?
We're not criminals.

00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:51.633
Speak for yourself, we're wanted
in three forests.

00:30:51.713 --> 00:30:55.337
And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased.

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.388
- I have to...
- That tickles!

00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:02.569
- Which way, Tutu?
- Down!

00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:04.982
Clear the way!

00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:08.912
- This way!
- Get off the road, Ma chéri.

00:31:09.753 --> 00:31:12.110
See you later, suckers.

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:21.943
We've done it!
We've done it! We...

00:31:22.024 --> 00:31:23.743
...missed it.

00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:25.840
Okay, boss, what's our next move?

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.524
We cut our loses, change our identities,
ditch the kid in the river.

00:31:29.604 --> 00:31:32.981
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.
- What about that bridge?

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:34.951
Yes! The Bridge!

00:31:35.031 --> 00:31:37.818
- That was my next suggestion.
- Let's go!

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:42.122
Come on, Doc. At least
get out of the hammock.

00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:45.117
Your sea sickness will wear off.

00:31:45.246 --> 00:31:49.111
Try some of this ginger root. You'll get
your sea lights back. You look terrible.

00:31:49.191 --> 00:31:52.283
Button it!
Who put me in this hammock?

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:55.058
I am the captain of this ship, mate!

00:31:55.197 --> 00:31:58.281
Raise the blasting sails, will you?

00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:01.556
That's a big bite.

00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:05.953
Everyone, look. Is that the boy?

00:32:06.033 --> 00:32:09.410
He's coming to finish the job.
He won't rest till I'm dead.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.191
- He's obsessed.
- John, slow the boat down!

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:16.524
- No. I wanna go faster.
- Sorry kid, John says no.

00:32:16.604 --> 00:32:18.965
- We're gonna miss all the good current!
- I hope they make it.

00:32:19.046 --> 00:32:21.132
Me too, Dabs.

00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:26.894
All right, Bets, moment of truth.

00:32:27.437 --> 00:32:29.675
Big hole, twelve o'clock!

00:32:29.755 --> 00:32:32.043
Maybe this is a bad idea.

00:32:33.688 --> 00:32:36.568
Let's go Stubbins! Let's go!

00:32:37.432 --> 00:32:39.108
I've run out of track!

00:32:39.188 --> 00:32:42.864
But not courage!
Fly, you big tree!

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:51.878
Vive la résistance!

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:57.048
Is that thing up to code?

00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:10.295
No!

00:33:10.411 --> 00:33:12.201
No!

00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:15.221
Jump, murderer. You got this!

00:33:22.517 --> 00:33:24.517
I can't look.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.640
No, no!

00:33:32.894 --> 00:33:35.660
Do it again, do it again!

00:33:35.727 --> 00:33:40.333
Yes! Crossed it, kid.
You made it.

00:33:40.413 --> 00:33:43.231
Why y'all cheering for the kid
who shot me?

00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:46.055
He's alright.

00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:49.860
- Poly, can I have a word please?
- Glad you came around and saw things...

00:33:52.814 --> 00:33:55.873
What was she thinking?
The boy nearly killed himself.

00:33:55.953 --> 00:34:00.055
Oy, this is my ship, right?
And I'm its sovereign.

00:34:00.114 --> 00:34:02.823
- And there are consequences--
- To ignoring me.

00:34:02.857 --> 00:34:05.869
- Is that what you were going to say?
- No, no! Don't mess my words.

00:34:05.949 --> 00:34:08.701
- And stop messing with my routine.
- Look at the state of you.

00:34:08.782 --> 00:34:12.060
- You're sick as a dog.
- Actually, I have my medicine.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.393
See? This licorice root is a treat!

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:17.842
Sit down, John!

00:34:19.548 --> 00:34:21.645
Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew!

00:34:21.725 --> 00:34:25.464
I'm sparing you embarrassment.
You need a trim.

00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:29.358
Alright, but quick.
It's important to maintain my status.

00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.795
This ship is dangerous.
No place for a...

00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:35.771
That's a private conversation.

00:34:35.851 --> 00:34:37.971
- Okay.
- Sorry.

00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:44.701
I know this particular voyage is hard
for you, John. It is for me, too.

00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:47.141
I brought to you Lily
just when you needed her.

00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:49.856
And now you need
one of your own kind again.

00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:53.185
Someone without feathers or fur.

00:34:53.942 --> 00:34:56.337
Fine, the boy can stay.
But it'll be on my terms.

00:34:56.417 --> 00:35:01.402
- And I mean to keep him quite busy.
- You'll do it with a smile on your face.

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:05.654
Crew, it seems you got a new shipmate.

00:35:09.985 --> 00:35:14.433
As I just told Poly, we are
a bit short-handed after all, so...

00:35:14.513 --> 00:35:16.794
- You won't regret it.
- Welcome aboard.

00:35:16.874 --> 00:35:20.402
I hear you can be a big help
by clearing this out.

00:35:20.482 --> 00:35:24.816
That, too, if you don't mind.
Oops, those as well. And that.

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:29.535
- I got these.
- Careful with that medical equipment!

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:35.125
Because a parrot's
in charge of my ship. Brilliant!

00:35:36.724 --> 00:35:39.914
He's absolutely thrilled to have you.

00:35:55.036 --> 00:35:59.066
Hello there, little squid.
You don't understand me, do you?

00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:01.152
That would be preposterous.

00:36:01.232 --> 00:36:04.019
- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:07.333
I'm dispatching a frigate, the Britania.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.598
To follow Dolittle.

00:36:10.678 --> 00:36:14.558
You must not support him
in his foolishness, My Lord.

00:36:18.788 --> 00:36:23.900
England has enemies everywhere
waiting for the slightest sign of weakness.

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:28.239
Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.013
That is lunacy.

00:36:30.093 --> 00:36:34.825
So, while I remain here ensuring
no one prevents me from taking the throne,

00:36:34.905 --> 00:36:37.414
you will be on the Britania,

00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:42.469
making certain Dolittle never returns.

00:36:55.466 --> 00:36:59.512
Round two, yeah! You got me on the rope,
but you have to jab, Cheech.

00:36:59.534 --> 00:37:02.991
Come on. One-two.
Jab. Jab. Pass.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.854
The best form of defense is attack.

00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:24.596
I really don't wanna fight you.

00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:28.140
We are not fighting, are we?
This is a very practic session.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.757
I think I'm getting this.
I'm actually starting to understand.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.807
Stop worrying, John.

00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:21.127
Every step is planned out in my journal.

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:25.011
I'll be back before you even miss me.

00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:36.669
Are you alright?

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.824
I think I'm beginning to understand
a little bit of what the animals say.

00:38:43.904 --> 00:38:46.117
Seems you are, boyo.

00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:56.942
What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?

00:38:57.022 --> 00:38:58.397
What kind of a bird...

00:38:58.477 --> 00:39:01.401
- Wait, are you even a bird?
- Of course I am.

00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.912
- Can you fly?
- No.

00:39:02.992 --> 00:39:04.335
- Can you swim?
- No.

00:39:04.415 --> 00:39:06.354
- What can you do?
- I can run.

00:39:06.434 --> 00:39:11.518
- I can run. What bird stuff can you do?
- What bear stuff can you do?

00:39:13.623 --> 00:39:15.623
You win this round.

00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:32.518
Pickles?

00:39:32.654 --> 00:39:35.355
Oh, you are saying warship.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.421
Weird, if you'd asked me for pickles.
Who could eat if we're under attack.

00:39:40.501 --> 00:39:45.287
Enemy! Starboard aft! Elliot,
you and Elsie, ready the machine.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:48.720
We gonna need speed,
send out the call!

00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:58.404
Secure the lifeboats!
This whole thing is a... death boat!

00:39:58.484 --> 00:40:01.666
Stubbins, boy.
I need you now more than ever.

00:40:01.746 --> 00:40:05.376
- Just stand still.
- I surrender! We surrender!

00:40:06.976 --> 00:40:10.099
Hello, Blair, you chinless wanderer.

00:40:10.535 --> 00:40:14.170
He said something about my chin,
didn't he?

00:40:14.308 --> 00:40:16.008
It's a magnificent chin, sir.

00:40:16.088 --> 00:40:19.097
We're in their sights.
Cannons are taking aim.

00:40:19.177 --> 00:40:21.578
Let's turn this ship!

00:40:23.343 --> 00:40:25.406
I'm on my way.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:29.874
It is time for me to
slip into something less comfortable.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:42.693
I've bought a front row seat
to crazy time!

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:48.477
Once Humphrey's been secured
you put me on to Yoshi's signal.

00:40:48.557 --> 00:40:51.118
Me? I can't handle
that type of pressure, Doc.

00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.943
I'm a cheer-quietly-from-the-sidelines
kinda gorilla.

00:40:54.023 --> 00:40:57.767
Don't worry, Cheech.
You'll rise to the occasion.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.738
You're stronger than you know.

00:41:00.818 --> 00:41:04.778
And remember,
courage is not the absence of fear.

00:41:05.537 --> 00:41:08.694
Wait! You got cut off.
I can't hear you.

00:41:08.774 --> 00:41:12.691
- I need the second part!
- No time, Cheech, let's go!

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:27.473
Oh, look, look! They are already
abandoning ship.

00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:29.053
Pull!

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:38.307
This is gonna be cold.
But I'm coming in hot.

00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:46.833
Humphrey here.

00:41:47.413 --> 00:41:49.430
Let's hook it up.

00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:59.750
- Where are we headed?
- South.

00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:07.143
Okay. I can do this. I can do this.

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:14.778
- Full steam ahead!
- Go, Humphrey! Go!

00:42:15.757 --> 00:42:17.982
Are they pulling away?

00:42:18.853 --> 00:42:22.002
- Do it, whale! Do it!
- It's working.

00:42:22.053 --> 00:42:23.312
How is this possible?

00:42:23.392 --> 00:42:25.681
It appears Dolittle and a polar bear
have harnessed the whale--

00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:29.253
It was a rhetorical question!
Just fire!

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.226
I dropped the rope!

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:48.546
I failed, I knew I couldn't do it.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.541
- Yoshi!
- Hang on! I'm coming, kid!

00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:08.684
- You're doing great.
- Oh, this is gonna murder my back!

00:43:08.774 --> 00:43:12.184
Quit complaining,
you oversized flamingo!

00:43:21.273 --> 00:43:23.273
Oh, no!

00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:28.963
Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.228
I let you down, Doc.

00:43:55.308 --> 00:43:58.791
Look at me.
I'm fine. We're all fine.

00:43:59.186 --> 00:44:03.677
- I froze.
- No, Cheech. It's okay to be scared.

00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:12.402
You saved me, did you?
Fair play. Thanks very much.

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:15.091
Well-done everybody.

00:44:16.434 --> 00:44:18.816
Feel like you belong now, kid?

00:44:18.896 --> 00:44:20.996
I guess I do.

00:44:21.008 --> 00:44:23.673
We lost them.
Great work, gang.

00:44:23.753 --> 00:44:26.357
Eat our dust, Müdfly!

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.614
They've gone away, sir.

00:44:36.694 --> 00:44:38.909
Oh, really? I thought
they disappeared into thin air.

00:44:38.989 --> 00:44:40.520
I'm afraid not, sir. They've escaped.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.099
Leave the room, Lieutenant!
I can see they've escaped.

00:44:44.633 --> 00:44:47.049
But not for long.

00:44:48.837 --> 00:44:52.562
It's a miracle, that must mean,
I am the chosen one.

00:44:52.642 --> 00:44:54.599
I'm gonna change the wor--

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:56.832
Whale power.

00:44:57.358 --> 00:45:01.904
Dolittle had to write a paper about it,
which, of course, nobody took seriously.

00:45:01.982 --> 00:45:05.697
This one even theorises
the existence of dragons.

00:45:05.777 --> 00:45:07.871
Just preposterous.

00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:10.359
Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle--

00:45:10.439 --> 00:45:13.788
What obsession?! I'm not obsessed with
Dolittle. You are obsessed with Dolittle.

00:45:13.868 --> 00:45:17.144
You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol--

00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:24.175
I loathe to admit it,
but he's more valuable alive for now.

00:45:24.538 --> 00:45:29.321
But, luckily, I think I know
where he's going.

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:35.465
Kevin's log, day seven.
I'm now totally isolated.

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:39.107
The enemy has ingratiated himself
with the captain and crew.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.237
No sign of promised tropical island,
or the magic fruit.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.670
But I will endure.

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.472
- Take the wheel, Stubbins.
- Really? - Yeah, yeah.

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:07.618
I have to calculate our route coordinates.
The bees are buzzing about you.

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:11.229
Seems you are getting
a rudimentary grasp of their language.

00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:14.225
Thirty five degrees fore side.

00:46:16.724 --> 00:46:19.531
I've noticed when they fly
in a zig-zag pattern.

00:46:19.611 --> 00:46:21.611
They sort of go...

00:46:23.726 --> 00:46:26.272
Which means "back off, kid."

00:46:26.352 --> 00:46:28.783
But when Dab-Dab goes...

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.115
That means "look at this."

00:46:34.195 --> 00:46:36.285
- "Look at me."
- Oh, close.

00:46:36.365 --> 00:46:38.217
Not bad, though.

00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:40.655
When Chee-Chee says...

00:46:41.002 --> 00:46:43.081
When Chee-Chee says...

00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:49.631
That means... "Where is my blanket?"

00:46:50.149 --> 00:46:52.149
Very good.

00:46:55.663 --> 00:46:57.873
Is that the map to Eden Tree island?

00:46:57.953 --> 00:47:01.359
The Eden Tree
cannot be found on any map.

00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:04.892
At core it's an island
is as suggestive as the whole world.

00:47:04.972 --> 00:47:07.449
And it is anything but.

00:47:07.529 --> 00:47:10.003
That is why we must first go
to Monte Verde.

00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:13.907
Birthplace of the only person
to ever chart course to the Tree.

00:47:13.987 --> 00:47:17.130
Her name was Lily.
She wrote the route in her journal,

00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:20.274
but on her voyage,
she was shipwrecked.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:24.235
The world lost the greatest explorer
I've ever known.

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:29.698
The journal from that expedition
is all that survived.

00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:36.687
Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?

00:47:38.955 --> 00:47:42.459
So, anyway, you get the picture.
To have any chance of finding the Tree,

00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:45.774
we have to go to Monte Verde
and steal that flippin' journal.

00:47:45.854 --> 00:47:48.980
- Steal the journal?
- Did I say that?

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.189
Well, what's the worst that can happen?

00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:59.434
Don't worry, I know an omen when
I see one. And that was not an omen.

00:48:01.429 --> 00:48:04.550
Stealing the journal is not a big deal.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.898
In fact,
Monte Verde itself is not a big deal.

00:48:13.327 --> 00:48:16.694
The stop at Monte Verde
was a very big deal.

00:48:16.774 --> 00:48:19.772
After all, this island
of bandits and thieves

00:48:19.852 --> 00:48:23.869
was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home.

00:48:23.938 --> 00:48:28.834
Until the Doctor made an enemy
of the island's notorious ruler,

00:48:28.914 --> 00:48:30.650
King Rassouli.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.303
And just our luck,
his most prized possession

00:48:33.383 --> 00:48:36.835
was the very journal
we needed to steal.

00:48:38.071 --> 00:48:40.948
So, Dolittle needed a disguise.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.220
While I was left watching over
the rest of the crew,

00:48:49.629 --> 00:48:53.546
Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace.

00:48:58.316 --> 00:49:00.387
I'm about to die!

00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:06.738
Once inside, their path ended
at a heavily bolted door, naturally.

00:49:06.823 --> 00:49:09.107
But, Dolittle still had...

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.910
questionable contacts on the island.

00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:19.316
The opening bid will suffice.
You have my attention.

00:49:19.396 --> 00:49:23.059
Don Carpenterino, I am here
on behalf of these humans,

00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:26.943
they will pay you handsomely
for your family's lock-picking skills.

00:49:27.023 --> 00:49:31.128
You come to me for this
on the day of my daughter's wedding?

00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:33.106
Wait a minute, which daughter?

00:49:33.186 --> 00:49:38.025
It's not... Sheila? My Sheila?
She's getting married?!

00:49:38.105 --> 00:49:39.841
To a scorpion named Dylan.

00:49:39.921 --> 00:49:43.528
Sorry, boy scout,
I guess Sheila's into bad boys now.

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.623
We were gonna spend
the rest of our lifespans together.

00:49:47.703 --> 00:49:51.220
Hold on, James. What's
your human's best offer?

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.523
Two now, and two later.

00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:58.845
Okay, you have yourself a deal.
See you around, boy scout.

00:49:59.482 --> 00:50:01.596
Guys. I'm no boy scout.

00:50:01.676 --> 00:50:06.328
Also, what that scorpion got that
I don't got? Besides a massive stinger.

00:50:06.408 --> 00:50:09.398
Get over it, James,
you dated for two weeks!

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:19.181
These bars are new.

00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:22.737
- Totally messing up my plan.
- I can fit through them.

00:50:22.817 --> 00:50:27.198
No, no. It's too dangerous, man.
Can't go in there on your own.

00:50:27.248 --> 00:50:28.837
Let me take him in, Doc.

00:50:28.917 --> 00:50:31.834
I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal.

00:50:31.914 --> 00:50:34.259
Are you sure your head's
in the right place, James?

00:50:34.339 --> 00:50:38.453
Oh, yeah! I'll get the kid in,
and then fly head first into a brick.

00:50:38.533 --> 00:50:40.533
Just kidding, I'm fine.

00:50:40.936 --> 00:50:43.978
Alright. James will look after you,
it's fine.

00:50:44.058 --> 00:50:46.909
Listen closely, get the journal,
you get out of there.

00:50:46.989 --> 00:50:49.755
Go through the room quietly,
look for the tiger's eye.

00:50:49.835 --> 00:50:54.651
Go down the hidden staircase, and most
importantly, keep your disguise on.

00:50:54.714 --> 00:50:56.945
There's just one little thing
you should know.

00:50:57.025 --> 00:50:59.784
Rassouli loves his cats.

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:08.253
But, that's no problem for us,
because we can just fly right over...

00:51:08.606 --> 00:51:12.232
Oh, I see the mistake
I made here. You can't fly.

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:23.036
Watch out, kitty-kat on your six.

00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:26.256
Oh, God!

00:51:27.577 --> 00:51:29.577
Slick move, kid.

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:35.500
We make a pretty good team.
A real couple of bad boys.

00:51:36.265 --> 00:51:39.309
Okay, partner, you know where to go.

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:05.688
I'll keep watch on these lions,
that's what a bad boy dragonfly does.

00:52:05.768 --> 00:52:10.108
Would Dylan get this close to a lion?
Would he get this close?

00:52:10.188 --> 00:52:12.132
How about this close?

00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:14.223
Oh, shit!

00:52:14.535 --> 00:52:18.080
This is bad... This is... very bad.

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:26.250
Lily... Dolittle.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:37.365
We got the journal, open up!
Just kidding, he blew it. Bye.

00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:39.623
Oh, dear! Stubbins!

00:52:39.904 --> 00:52:41.904
Don't let him get to...

00:52:43.694 --> 00:52:46.481
- Former resident here.
- Don't move!

00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:49.381
Don't touch.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.759
All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,

00:52:56.839 --> 00:53:00.607
and instead I got the ring leader
of a circus.

00:53:00.687 --> 00:53:04.149
I never understood
what Lily saw in you.

00:53:04.229 --> 00:53:09.147
A common complaint the world over
for fathers of beloved daughters,

00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:15.728
but in this instance I think we can
all agree it is particularly accurate.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.780
Come here.

00:53:23.447 --> 00:53:26.953
- Come here!
- Perhaps, you didn't mean any of that--

00:53:27.546 --> 00:53:30.082
It was her journal.

00:53:30.162 --> 00:53:34.335
The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage.

00:53:34.415 --> 00:53:37.051
It belongs here!

00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:43.481
All you had to do
was never show your face again.

00:53:44.397 --> 00:53:48.577
And even at that you failed.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.946
Now you will pay
for taking Lily away from me!

00:53:54.555 --> 00:53:58.094
You knew what would happen
if you returned.

00:53:58.271 --> 00:54:00.271
Yes.

00:54:05.317 --> 00:54:07.575
Barry, Barry!

00:54:13.517 --> 00:54:15.536
You should go.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.801
It's my past that's caught up with me,
not yours. Yeah?

00:54:20.881 --> 00:54:24.001
- You're my friend.
- Go. Don't look back.

00:54:30.924 --> 00:54:33.805
You're better off without him, kid.

00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:38.256
I'm in compliance.

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:43.142
Yes! Finally, some action down here!
Boy, it was getting boring.

00:54:43.185 --> 00:54:46.243
You know, Doc, I hate to tell you,
but you're going down, my friend.

00:54:46.318 --> 00:54:48.860
You'll do well to keep
your buck teeth together!

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:54.476
What is that smell? Hey, fellas, I think
Doctor Dolittle did a little doo-doo.

00:54:54.556 --> 00:54:56.427
Did Doctor Dolittle do a little doo-doo?

00:54:56.507 --> 00:54:58.848
Perhaps, when I'm out of here,
I'll teach you some manners.

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:01.523
And accept your lucky foot as payment.

00:55:01.603 --> 00:55:04.397
Oh, this lucky foot?
Don't worry about it, Doc.

00:55:04.477 --> 00:55:07.436
'Cause both of my lucky feet
are gonna be tap dancing on your grave

00:55:07.485 --> 00:55:09.847
when my guy's done with you.

00:55:10.357 --> 00:55:14.228
Taking bets over here. In the right
corner, wearing golden stripes

00:55:14.315 --> 00:55:17.955
with a sparkling record of 872 kills,

00:55:18.035 --> 00:55:24.015
Barry 'The Butcher' Burnstein.

00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:33.922
Doctor Dolittle, remember me,
your old patient?

00:55:34.002 --> 00:55:36.002
It's Barry.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.668
Barry, how could I forget you?

00:55:39.748 --> 00:55:44.773
Oh, but you did, Doc. We were
just starting to make progress.

00:55:44.853 --> 00:55:50.289
And then you ran off with
Rassouli's daughter and abandoned me.

00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:54.375
I'm back now. Perhaps we should
just pick up where we left--

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.539
Enjoy the feast!

00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:04.209
What will happen to Dolittle?

00:56:04.773 --> 00:56:07.480
Well, he's a dead man.

00:56:08.241 --> 00:56:11.573
He'll think he can talk
his way out of it,

00:56:11.717 --> 00:56:15.007
but Barry has gone completely nuts.

00:56:15.092 --> 00:56:19.262
But you, you are one of us now.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.306
To Dolittle's death!

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:32.066
Hey! It's you! You made it.

00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:34.961
I need you to get a message
to my friends on the boat.

00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:38.674
A message? Sure.
When have I ever let you down?

00:56:39.046 --> 00:56:44.507
All I hear day after day,
"Oh, Barry, you're such a disappointment.

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:49.677
Why can't you be more like your brother?
He eats poachers for a living, you know."

00:56:49.757 --> 00:56:55.763
Yes, Mother, I know!
The whole jungle knows!

00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:57.994
Oh, my head.

00:56:58.074 --> 00:57:01.301
Your migraines are brought on
by severe maternal issues,

00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:03.648
and compounded by sibling rivalry.

00:57:03.728 --> 00:57:07.292
- Please, make it stop.
- Oh, no, no!

00:57:07.908 --> 00:57:09.803
- Lie down.
- Oh, my head.

00:57:09.883 --> 00:57:13.692
We could resume your treatment.

00:57:13.772 --> 00:57:19.023
The stress is unbearable.
I just want to be a good boy.

00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:22.089
Just want to make Mommy proud.

00:57:22.169 --> 00:57:23.333
Yeah?

00:57:23.413 --> 00:57:26.537
No one I eat will ever be good enough.

00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:29.312
There's the release, release it.

00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:32.285
I will never be good enough.

00:57:32.665 --> 00:57:35.619
Unless I eat you.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:45.567
Because every mother wants their son
to grow up and eat a doctor.

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:47.740
You're a sick kitty.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:54.438
Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick.

00:57:54.518 --> 00:57:57.210
I've got another one of these
in an hour.

00:57:58.231 --> 00:58:01.537
Give up, Dolittle. You can't outsmart--

00:58:01.617 --> 00:58:05.203
What was that?
Wait. Now it's over there.

00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:06.807
And now it's over here.

00:58:06.887 --> 00:58:09.881
Now it's back over there, got it!
And now it's over here.

00:58:09.961 --> 00:58:11.748
Oh, I lost it. I've got to get it--

00:58:11.828 --> 00:58:15.811
A cat is still a cat. Easily distracted.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:20.415
New game, Doc. Get back here.

00:58:21.147 --> 00:58:23.147
Come on, Doc!

00:58:24.414 --> 00:58:28.393
Okay, James, you can't let this kid
down. You gotta deliver this message.

00:58:28.473 --> 00:58:30.411
Oh, no. It's James.

00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:35.344
From now on no more
focusing on relationships and...

00:58:36.163 --> 00:58:40.998
Poly? Is that you?
Your feathers really filled out nice.

00:58:41.078 --> 00:58:44.427
- What happened, James?
- Oh, right! Message. My bad.

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:48.884
The kid's been captured by Rassouli, and
Barry is about to have Dolittle for lunch.

00:58:48.964 --> 00:58:51.138
Looks like we're going ashore after all.

00:58:51.218 --> 00:58:54.341
Be a darling, and grab my dynamite,
will you?

00:58:55.822 --> 00:58:59.206
We need to split up
if we are going to pull this off.

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:00.969
Chee-Chee, you're coming with me.

00:59:01.049 --> 00:59:03.107
Where are we going?
No, no, don't tell me.

00:59:03.187 --> 00:59:05.264
Just tell me when we get there.

00:59:05.586 --> 00:59:09.470
- Yoshi, create a distraction.
- Hope this is enough.

00:59:15.235 --> 00:59:17.928
We are being attacked!

00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:26.179
- Come on down, Doc.
- Therapy's the answer!

00:59:26.259 --> 00:59:29.182
Oh, no! Worse than I expected.

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:35.507
- I got you, Doc.
- Back off, Barry!

00:59:35.587 --> 00:59:37.587
Poly, don't!

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:40.688
An appetizer?

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:44.619
I got you, Poly.

00:59:46.729 --> 00:59:48.692
Any final diagnosis, Doc?

00:59:48.772 --> 00:59:51.493
Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?

00:59:51.573 --> 00:59:53.573
I'm about to.

00:59:54.641 --> 00:59:57.243
I am not a prisoner of fear!

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:02.863
I am not a prisoner of fear!
- Oh, no, no, no!

01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:05.466
It's okay to be scared!

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.706
- It's okay to be scared!
- You should be scared!

01:00:12.786 --> 01:00:15.064
It's okay to be scared!

01:00:15.658 --> 01:00:17.019
Give him a good hiding!

01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:20.130
Okay. We're doing this.
We are doing this!

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.326
We're not doing this!

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.156
Hit him in the low area!

01:00:28.236 --> 01:00:30.869
Down there.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:38.816
- That's gotta hurt.
- Ow, my Barry berries!

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.918
That will work.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.563
Cheap shot, ape.

01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:51.571
I haven't finished by treatment.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.006
Go to sleep, baby tiger.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:59.493
Time to put those claws away.

01:01:01.207 --> 01:01:02.909
Anyway.

01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:05.503
You need this more than I do.

01:01:05.742 --> 01:01:08.454
Tell me that I'm enough, Mommy.

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:11.099
I had fifty grand running on that.

01:01:12.186 --> 01:01:13.882
Well, I won't pay that.

01:01:13.886 --> 01:01:17.038
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:21.214
Thanks for sticking with me, Doc.

01:01:44.184 --> 01:01:47.368
- I have it. I have this.
- Hold!

01:01:50.217 --> 01:01:52.883
And now, I'll have it.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.783
She had such a sure hand.

01:02:01.863 --> 01:02:04.781
Exactly what the doctor ordered.

01:02:09.509 --> 01:02:13.672
What did they offer you, Müdfly,
to murder the Queen of England?

01:02:14.538 --> 01:02:16.424
Quite a few things, actually.

01:02:16.504 --> 01:02:20.692
Knighthood. Windward house.
Chair of the Royal College.

01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:22.746
In no particular order.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:26.372
Oh, and the icing on the Madeleine

01:02:26.483 --> 01:02:28.958
will be the scientific accolades
that accrue

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:32.233
from the proper study
of the Eden Tree.

01:02:32.258 --> 01:02:37.320
All thanks to Lily Dolittle.
Actually, no. That's still Madeleine.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.822
The icing is knowing
that you know I won.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.618
Oh, and Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat.

01:02:50.698 --> 01:02:52.768
What hole?

01:03:01.728 --> 01:03:04.571
Abandon ship! Everyone overboard!

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.252
Not good.

01:03:15.803 --> 01:03:17.803
Hold on!

01:03:19.388 --> 01:03:22.129
- Help!
- I'm on it, Doc.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:27.691
I can't fly... and I can't swim.

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:35.856
I got you, buddy. Plimpton?
I'm not losing you, bro.

01:03:35.904 --> 01:03:41.085
- Step away from the light!
- There is no light! I'm alive! I'm alive.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.285
I'm alive. Thanks to you, Yoshi.

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:11.017
You've always been so kind.

01:04:14.115 --> 01:04:17.045
It's difficult to say goodbye.

01:04:17.877 --> 01:04:20.052
Please don't say that.

01:04:20.132 --> 01:04:22.176
It's alright.

01:04:25.812 --> 01:04:30.344
You've done your best.
Your Queen is proud.

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:37.274
Where are you Dolittle?

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.870
Hey, big bird, you're doing okay?

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:45.408
No. Nothing about me is okay.

01:04:45.488 --> 01:04:47.926
My father was right about me.

01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:52.335
- I should've been an omelet.
- I know how you feel.

01:04:52.415 --> 01:04:55.007
My dad said he was going
for a pack of seals one night,

01:04:55.075 --> 01:04:57.672
and never came back.

01:04:57.752 --> 01:05:01.159
I guess we got something in common
after all, Plimpton.

01:05:01.247 --> 01:05:06.707
What is this feeling?
I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:09.899
That's friendship, bro.

01:05:10.626 --> 01:05:12.669
Not bad.

01:05:12.749 --> 01:05:14.749
Bro.

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:20.305
I'm not crying, you're crying.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:38.052
Right. Gather around, shall we?
Let's have a look where we are now.

01:05:38.132 --> 01:05:40.382
That's the spirit, John.

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:47.152
This is gonna be good.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.543
I'm already getting duckbumps.

01:05:52.966 --> 01:05:55.038
- We are finished.
- What?

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.493
Is this a pep talk?
'Cause it's a weird one.

01:05:57.566 --> 01:06:00.813
I can sniff defeat like a truffle pig.

01:06:01.716 --> 01:06:03.481
This can't be the end.

01:06:03.561 --> 01:06:06.705
- Yeah. I suppose.
- We can still save the Queen.

01:06:06.785 --> 01:06:09.493
- No.
- We can still save your house.

01:06:11.047 --> 01:06:13.073
I believe in you.

01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:15.932
- We can keep coming.
- You got a point there.

01:06:16.012 --> 01:06:19.280
Except the journal's gone.
We have no way to find the Eden Tree.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.623
- And our boat is sunk.
- He makes a strong argument.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.085
On the plus side, you are all cured.

01:06:27.165 --> 01:06:32.215
Chee-Chee, you are brave now.
Plimpton and Yoshi are getting along.

01:06:32.295 --> 01:06:34.580
- Remember back? Back.
- Sort of.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.365
And Stubbins, you've made friends,
and you can even talk to them.

01:06:38.445 --> 01:06:39.832
You don't need me.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:44.204
I'll stay here and offer medical services
to this island of random bandits...

01:06:44.284 --> 01:06:48.936
and outlaws. The doctor's here,
seeking new patients! Cash only.

01:06:49.014 --> 01:06:52.208
Ladies, Gentlemen,
who would like to dance?

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:56.962
I got a bad case of dancing fever,
so, watch out, it's infectious.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.435
Can't help him.

01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:03.492
The explorer you told me about,
she would've never given up.

01:07:03.572 --> 01:07:07.778
- She was your wife, wasn't she?
- You wanna know the ironic bit?

01:07:07.929 --> 01:07:10.488
I don't know what ironic means.

01:07:11.355 --> 01:07:14.442
Irony is when you find a woman,

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.654
and she makes your life more wonderful
than it ever had the right to be.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.757
And then poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault.

01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:25.167
This journey was my chance
to finish what she started.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:33.143
Lily insisted I cared for the animals
at home, so I stayed behind.

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:36.532
Rassouli's right.
I should've been with her.

01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:41.303
All I have left of her is a ghost I see
when I hold our rings.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.951
So, you see her, too?

01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:51.710
Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal,

01:07:51.938 --> 01:07:56.328
but your polar bear blew up my village.

01:07:56.408 --> 01:07:58.684
We don't know that.

01:07:59.058 --> 01:08:02.749
And your gorilla beat up my tiger.

01:08:03.189 --> 01:08:05.189
No good.

01:08:08.553 --> 01:08:10.143
Let's go.

01:08:10.223 --> 01:08:12.276
No, no.

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:25.969
Irony... is me

01:08:26.262 --> 01:08:32.038
wanting to kill you
with every fiber of my being,

01:08:33.498 --> 01:08:35.698
but...

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.212
...loving my daughter more.

01:08:48.074 --> 01:08:50.612
I miss her, too.

01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:55.719
She would've wanted you to...

01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:58.272
to keep going.

01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:07.543
So!

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:15.343
Keep going, before
I stop feeling sentimental.

01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:21.339
She's saying we don't have a ship.

01:09:22.081 --> 01:09:24.081
Well...

01:09:24.413 --> 01:09:27.594
I have the perfect vessel for you.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:32.733
A bit of a fixer-upper.
He's got... good boat.

01:09:32.813 --> 01:09:34.348
At least it flows.

01:09:34.428 --> 01:09:37.492
We'll just have to make
the best of it, won't we?

01:09:38.698 --> 01:09:41.739
- Company!
- Who's that?

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:44.198
Hi, I'm Jeff.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.347
Crikey!

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:51.137
If Lily's research was correct

01:09:51.217 --> 01:09:54.727
and Müdfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree island,

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.535
all we needed to do was track Müdfly.

01:09:58.806 --> 01:10:00.938
But how do we do that?

01:10:01.018 --> 01:10:04.218
Whales, boyo. Whales.

01:10:20.866 --> 01:10:25.878
- I can't believe you're flipping him off.
- I know, that man has no chin.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:56.794
We found him. Follow us.

01:11:05.945 --> 01:11:08.003
Eden Tree island.

01:11:28.134 --> 01:11:30.390
Extraordinary.

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:46.438
This must be it.

01:11:46.518 --> 01:11:51.181
The map points us directly
into the centre of this mountain.

01:11:52.939 --> 01:11:55.397
Don't look down. Let's keep
our beaks up, shall we?

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:58.926
Trying to stay positive. But
what the heck are we doing up here?

01:11:59.006 --> 01:12:01.611
Going the back way,
my feathered buddy.

01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:06.074
What are you complaining about? This is
the widest branch I've ever scurried on.

01:12:06.157 --> 01:12:08.757
Don't look down. Look at me.

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:12.609
Whoa. A big cave.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.193
Stay close. Keep quiet.

01:12:20.273 --> 01:12:21.611
Kevin's log. Day 12.

01:12:21.691 --> 01:12:25.827
Some force beyond my comprehension still
compels me to follow this crew of lunatics,

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:28.344
the squirrel killer,
and their deranged leader.

01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:31.569
Perhaps, it's the magic tree
that draws me.

01:12:31.649 --> 01:12:33.145
Hide, they're close.

01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:35.440
---, Now stay down.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.936
Foxfire rocks.

01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:51.918
We must be near it now.

01:12:54.186 --> 01:12:56.066
Look, Doc.

01:12:56.146 --> 01:12:58.792
It's lighting a path all the way to...

01:12:58.872 --> 01:13:00.926
the man who wants us dead.

01:13:01.006 --> 01:13:03.006
Stay right there!

01:13:04.294 --> 01:13:07.250
Go on then, soldier boy.
Spoil it yourself.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.972
Hello, Blair.

01:13:15.674 --> 01:13:18.649
- Get over there!
- Looking for a Tree, is it?

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:24.651
Trees don't often grow in caves. Didn't
you pay attention to botany class?

01:13:24.731 --> 01:13:28.319
No! But pay attention to this, Dolittle.

01:13:28.739 --> 01:13:32.015
I beat you.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.804
- Filthy animal.
- Let go!

01:13:36.267 --> 01:13:38.267
Order!

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:42.863
So.

01:13:42.943 --> 01:13:46.296
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.106
- The Eden Tree.
- Truth is...

01:13:50.186 --> 01:13:52.553
I haven't got a clue.

01:13:52.611 --> 01:13:57.404
Don't be ridiculous, you're John Dolittle.
You get everything you want.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.145
Not today I don't.

01:14:00.849 --> 01:14:04.115
You really don't have any idea, do you?

01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:07.727
How does ignorance feel?

01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:11.714
Very freeing, actually.

01:14:11.794 --> 01:14:14.811
One must hug uncertainty,
don't you think?

01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:17.672
That's how Lily lived her life.

01:14:19.039 --> 01:14:22.932
And brace the unknown and...
the answers will be revealed.

01:14:23.012 --> 01:14:27.693
You sad, misguided nut, Dolittle!

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.344
Give that to me! Give me that!

01:14:32.828 --> 01:14:36.014
I will find this damn Tree on my own!

01:14:36.094 --> 01:14:40.251
And by God, history will remember me!

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.317
Yes. Something interesting
is going on now.

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:03.604
It rather feels a lot larger
than all of us.

01:15:10.503 --> 01:15:12.347
Look out!

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:22.613
Down here, the lot of you! Come on!

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.914
Stay down!

01:15:26.123 --> 01:15:29.532
He saved me. I have a second chance...

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:33.784
to live a life of kindness
and generosity.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:43.076
Take him, not me.
I am a good person now.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:10.162
I think we can make a run
for that ditch. Once it's--

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.800
- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.405
- Cheech.
- Help me, Plimpton.

01:16:16.485 --> 01:16:19.400
- I'll save you, bro.
- Right, John, think fast.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.880
Take this off of me!

01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:27.281
This will likely upset her a bit!

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.585
No!

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.787
Dolittle! Help!

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.511
Is he speaking dragon?

01:17:05.529 --> 01:17:09.985
You may be able to speak my language,

01:17:10.065 --> 01:17:14.609
but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit.

01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:17.200
I know protecting the Tree is your duty,

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.771
but you won't be able to continue
much longer

01:17:19.851 --> 01:17:23.748
considering the damage you've taken,
and the pain you're in.

01:17:24.114 --> 01:17:27.671
You know nothing of my pain.

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:37.010
But I do. I had it as well.

01:17:37.249 --> 01:17:40.103
The kind that doesn't come
from a bullet or a blade,

01:17:40.183 --> 01:17:42.645
but cuts much deeper.

01:17:42.974 --> 01:17:48.390
And now in every moment, in every
movement you feel that pain again.

01:17:52.982 --> 01:17:55.503
It's hard to carry on...

01:18:00.626 --> 01:18:03.839
...when you've lost the one you love.

01:18:16.565 --> 01:18:20.090
Just leave!

01:18:27.462 --> 01:18:30.578
- What just happened?
- Ah, broken hearts...

01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:32.396
What the heck are you doing here?

01:18:32.476 --> 01:18:35.207
Don't worry guys, I got this.
We're both dragons.

01:18:35.287 --> 01:18:38.638
Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon.

01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:41.090
If you wouldn't mind telling me what...

01:18:41.148 --> 01:18:44.371
She's really mad, I'll wait
for whoever survives outside.

01:18:44.495 --> 01:18:47.710
John, let's just get out of here
while we still can.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:51.315
No. I think we are here to help her.

01:18:53.309 --> 01:18:57.036
Yeah.
We haven't got much time!

01:18:58.682 --> 01:19:01.277
I imagine it's a bit tender here.

01:19:04.784 --> 01:19:08.462
I'm unarmed.
I pose no threat to you.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:12.667
Emotional stress over the years
has done damage to your stomach.

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.593
Get away from me!

01:19:14.673 --> 01:19:17.134
You have severe infection of colon.

01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:20.088
And if I don't manually fragment it,
it will go septic.

01:19:20.153 --> 01:19:23.063
And you won't be able to protect
anything anymore.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.083
- That sounds like some tummy ache.
- I'll tell you what.

01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:28.587
Give us five minutes.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.827
If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all--

01:19:30.907 --> 01:19:34.257
Stop talking! Just get on with it.

01:19:35.513 --> 01:19:37.773
We have to get you on your side.

01:19:37.853 --> 01:19:40.195
We need to perform
an emergency extraction.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:43.846
- Extraction? What are we pulling out?
- Go get it, Doc.

01:19:43.896 --> 01:19:46.884
- We got your back, Doc.
- It's showtime.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.860
Three, two, one. Turn!

01:19:52.704 --> 01:19:55.145
Chee-Chee, chuck me the forceps.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:58.517
- Knew it will come in handy. Told ya!
- Everybody knows what to do to do?

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.572
- Just breathe.
- Works for me.

01:20:00.652 --> 01:20:03.828
It's okay, just hold on to
my wing, sweetie. Dab-Dab's here.

01:20:03.908 --> 01:20:08.260
Oy! You are my apprentice.
You keep her calm.

01:20:10.043 --> 01:20:13.189
Did you know that leek
is the national emblem of Wales?

01:20:13.269 --> 01:20:16.691
Very useful it is, too.
You might feel... a bit of pressure.

01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:18.790
I got her.

01:20:20.204 --> 01:20:21.861
Oh, good heavens!

01:20:21.941 --> 01:20:24.646
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Oh my God!

01:20:25.366 --> 01:20:28.900
- Just clearing the way.
- Is that hardware?

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.257
You've got
the whole Spanish army in here!

01:20:33.645 --> 01:20:36.405
Give us a deep breath. Hold it.

01:20:36.485 --> 01:20:37.952
- A word of warning...
- What's up, Doc?

01:20:38.032 --> 01:20:41.542
When we're removing the blockage...
Yoshi, now.

01:20:41.622 --> 01:20:44.778
There may be
an initial release of wind.

01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:57.592
- Respect.
- It's all right. Nobody heard that.

01:20:57.672 --> 01:21:02.675
Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all do it. We are all animals.

01:21:03.126 --> 01:21:04.826
I can taste it!

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:07.246
Okay, I'm back. What did I miss?

01:21:07.326 --> 01:21:09.392
Oh my God!

01:21:09.472 --> 01:21:11.986
- This is the big one!
- We're in the home stretch now!

01:21:12.066 --> 01:21:15.748
- Chee-Chee, get behind me.
- I'm with you, Doc. On your call.

01:21:19.972 --> 01:21:22.883
Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red.

01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:26.348
One last push, madam, if you please.

01:21:38.176 --> 01:21:40.283
Thank you.

01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:44.035
- We did it!
- Team work makes the dream work.

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:48.529
That was the one. We did good.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:57.593
To put it simply, more leafy greens,
and less armor in your diet.

01:21:58.928 --> 01:22:04.161
I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you.

01:22:04.369 --> 01:22:08.188
What unites such a group of creatures?

01:22:08.268 --> 01:22:12.084
Well, we may not look it, right?
But somehow...

01:22:13.436 --> 01:22:18.793
- ...we just belong together.
- Now let me help you.

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:38.160
Lily would have loved it, John.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.788
We would never have found it
without her.

01:22:41.438 --> 01:22:44.855
I just got the chills.
And I'm not even cold.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:12.534
Thank you for showing me
the way, my love.

01:23:23.417 --> 01:23:27.145
--- Raise her up

01:23:27.225 --> 01:23:31.070
and restore her, to a longer
continuance amongst us.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.607
O Father of mercies
and Lord of all comfort--

01:23:33.687 --> 01:23:36.877
I'm sorry we couldn't save you,
Your Majesty.

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:43.046
It is with great sadness--

01:23:43.126 --> 01:23:46.266
Wait a minute, I smell something.
It smells like...

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:52.526
- Hope!
- ...that I have to announce...

01:23:53.841 --> 01:23:57.380
- ...that the Queen is no longer--
- Somebody called a doctor?

01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:01.252
My mates! Very dramatic
entrance, boys. Well played.

01:24:01.332 --> 01:24:03.153
- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!

01:24:03.233 --> 01:24:06.048
Clear a path, there isn't
a moment to waste!

01:24:08.393 --> 01:24:12.565
I have procured that
what you said does not exist.

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:15.968
Behold, the fruit of the Eden Tree.

01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:19.752
I said clear a path.

01:24:19.832 --> 01:24:21.939
Seize them!

01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:25.314
Sorry.

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.422
- Go!
- Seize them!

01:24:35.499 --> 01:24:38.081
You were born for this moment.

01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:40.161
I'm fine.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.569
Mini, take flight!

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.747
Go! Go!

01:24:53.339 --> 01:24:55.339
No! No!

01:25:36.982 --> 01:25:39.348
Kevin's log. Day unknown.

01:25:39.428 --> 01:25:42.598
The killing has ended.
Let there be life!

01:25:43.395 --> 01:25:45.395
Lady Rose.

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:50.263
Is that a giraffe in my bedchamber?

01:25:50.343 --> 01:25:51.491
Yes!

01:25:51.571 --> 01:25:57.231
Oh, yes. And a polar bear, and a gorilla,
and a parrot and a duck, and ostrich.

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:03.663
A humble thanks be to God!

01:26:04.555 --> 01:26:07.464
And well done, Doctor Dolittle.

01:26:07.544 --> 01:26:10.290
Not quite done, are we?

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:13.367
Interesting, carry on, Sticks.
I'm all ears.

01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:15.360
What's that?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.930
Sticks here agreed to stay behind,
keep his 12 eyes on things.

01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:20.730
He's was just catching me up.

01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:26.261
Like all leaf insects, he speaks
in iterable phrases, and he states,

01:26:27.088 --> 01:26:29.965
Lord Badgley did poison the Queen.

01:26:30.045 --> 01:26:32.202
What? He did?

01:26:32.204 --> 01:26:34.847
Really, Dolittle? This is too much.

01:26:34.927 --> 01:26:38.342
You're certain?
Well, this should be the time.

01:26:38.422 --> 01:26:41.721
No, I'm sorry,
Sticks is quite adamant.

01:26:42.242 --> 01:26:46.464
In his right pocket the vial.

01:26:46.544 --> 01:26:48.361
That would be seven.

01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:51.911
In his right pocket the vial
of deathly nightshade.

01:26:52.190 --> 01:26:53.935
Let's have a look, shall we?

01:26:54.015 --> 01:26:58.495
You can't possibly believe
that he's talking to an insect.

01:26:59.241 --> 01:27:03.015
Well, I've spoken to ladybugs,

01:27:03.129 --> 01:27:06.130
making a wish before they fly away.

01:27:06.427 --> 01:27:08.427
Let's have a look.

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:21.285
No one messes with my family!
Take one more step and I'll rip you a--

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.860
To the Tower with him.

01:27:31.099 --> 01:27:34.837
- Someone's been a bad boy.
- Come on.

01:27:35.415 --> 01:27:37.678
I don't know why you all standing there.

01:27:37.758 --> 01:27:39.918
Nobody's died. Leave me in peace.

01:27:40.608 --> 01:27:42.608
You too.

01:27:44.141 --> 01:27:47.027
Not you, Doctor Dolittle.

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:49.647
A moment, if you would please.

01:27:51.493 --> 01:27:54.608
Lady Rose, who is this person
and why is he staring at me?

01:27:54.688 --> 01:27:56.698
He's Stubbins.

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:59.954
I want to be an animal doctor.

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.294
He saved your life.

01:28:14.144 --> 01:28:17.444
Thank you.
It's good to have you back, doctor.

01:28:22.377 --> 01:28:24.132
Polly!

01:28:24.213 --> 01:28:27.852
- Anything you'd like to say to me?
- You were right, I suppose.

01:28:27.933 --> 01:28:30.644
It is nice to get out of the
house every once in a while.

01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:35.144
Stubbins, Mini! Enough, we have
far less important places to be.

01:28:44.803 --> 01:28:47.936
Our story ends the way it began.

01:28:47.936 --> 01:28:52.147
I have a letter for Doctor Dolittle.
Somebody get me down!

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:53.883
Mostly.

01:28:53.963 --> 01:28:56.995
There once was a peculiar doctor.

01:28:58.403 --> 01:29:02.469
Who found he was
at his best when sharing

01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:06.716
his extraordinary ability with others.
- Excellent.

01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:13.008
Soon, Doctor Dolittle re-opened his gates
as Lily would have wanted.

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:16.684
- Three more in the queue, gang.
- Copy that.

01:29:18.126 --> 01:29:21.930
Dolittle discovered his place
in the world once again.

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:35.110
After all, it's only by helping others
that we can truly help ourselves.
